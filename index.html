    <div class="parent">
        <div class="child">One</div>

        <div class="child">Four</div>

    <p class="text-one">Flex Grow - child classname<br/><br />
        The parent element was 800px
        <br />
        Each child element was flex-basis 100px wide
        <br />
        This left the parent element a remainer of 400px not in use by the child elements
        <br />
        Then added a flex-grow of 1 which added to the child classname, this divided the extra 400px in the parent element, and added it equally to each child element
        <br/>  
        This then made all the child elements fill the parent container</p>
    <p class="text-two">Flex Grow - child element 4 only<br /><br />
        The parent element was 800px
        <br />
        Each child element was flex-basis 100px wide
        <br />
        This left the parent element a remainer of 400px not in use by the child elements
        <br />
        Then added a flex-grow of 1 to child element 4, which then added the extra 400px in the parent element to
        child element 4 only. 
        <br />
        Which will make child element 4, 500px wide and all the other child elements will remain at 100px
    </p>
    <p class="text-three">
        Flex Grow - child element 3  and 4 only<br /><br/>
        The parent element was 800px
        <br />
        Each child element was flex-basis 100px wide
        <br />
        This left the parent element a remainer of 400px not in use by the child elements
        <br />
        Then added a flex-grow of 1 to child element 4 and flex-grow 2 to child 3
        <br/> 
        This will give 3 parts of the parent 400px to child element 3
        <br/>
        400/3=133 Parent element divived by three parts 
        <br />
        133x2=266 Then from above the 133 times the the flex-grow which is 2 for child element 3
        <br/> 
        266+100 The 266 from above added to the 100px in child element 3, gives the child element 3 a grand pixel amount of 366px 
        <br/> 
        For child element 4 its grand pixel amount is about 233   
    </p>
    <p class="text-four">
        All the child class names are gave a size of flex-basis 400px each, which in grand pixel total is 1600px
        <br>
        Which is bigger then the parent element of 800px
        <br/> 
        So css will share the 800px space in equal amounts between the 4 child elements
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Flex Shrink
        <br />
        Then I added flex-shrink:2; to child element two, this will now reduce that element twice as much as the other elements
